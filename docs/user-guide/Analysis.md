# 6. Analysis 
This portion of the guide will explain how to normalize conditions, compare individual metabolites, enter time points, and enter quantitative standards.

## <h3>6.1 Compare Metabolites</h3>
This button allows the user to compare selected metabolites.

### <h3>6.1.0 Make the Options Appear</h3>
Make the options appear by hovering over the Compare Metabolites Button and then left click.

## <h3>6.2  Normalize Abundances</h3>
This button allows the user to normalize data based on an experimental condition, an internal standard (metabolite) and/or by individual cell numbers/sample mass.
    
### <h3>6.2.1 Make Options Appear</h3>
Hover over Enter Cell Number and left click to make the menu appear.

## <h3>6.4 Enter Quantitative Standards</h3>
This portion of the user guide will explain how to input quantitative standards including: Standard Isotopologue, Standard Concentration, Concentration Units, and Total Abundance. The Standard Concentration input will only be selectable if a Standard Isotopologue selection other than NA is selected.

### <h3>6.4.1 Making Options Appear</h3>
Hover over the Enter Quantitative Standards button and left click.

After Click:
