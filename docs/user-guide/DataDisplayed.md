## <h3>5.2 Isotopologues to Display</h3>
This portion of the user guide will explain how to select certain isotopologues to display. The majority of the user instructions will be found above in the Metabolites to Display portion. The main difference is how to select individual metabolite’s isotopologues. Rather than clicking a box, the user must click a dropdown menu and select which isotopologue to end with. For example, M3 includes M0, M1, M2, M3. M0 only includes M0. The default for isotopologues displayed is all possible isotopologues. The changes will be applied to ALL graph types of the selected metabolite.
