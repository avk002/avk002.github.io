# 2. Edit the Individual Graphs
After Navigating to one of the sets of graphs you can change the title or the label on the left axis by clicking on either and typing the desired name. You can also get a separate graph of each individual isotopologue. This applies to all graphs available in the tool, not only the ones showed in this user guide.


## <h3>2.1	Right Click on Graphs</h3>
Right Clicking on Graphs will show a dropdown menu that includes five options: Delete, Show Data, Download, Change Graph, and multiple fragments of the individual Metabolite. All of these aspects are accessed through this context menu that appears on a right click. These operations work the same on the set of bar graphs AND on the individual graphs of isotopologues.

After Right Clicking on Graph:

To get rid of the dropdown menu simply click away from the graph and menu.


### <h3>2.1.1	Delete Graph</h3>
To delete a graph click on delete after making the dropdown menu appear.
